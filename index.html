            <strong>WOW. Ok.</strong> This is completely nuts. We are so very sorry that you have had difficulties buying your books from us. We never expected this kind of response and had 10 times the amount of people trying to purchase at the same time and it completely crashed our site.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are working feverishly to get the site to a place to handle all of the traffic. Unfortunately, this literally broke our current website which will require us to shift over to a new platform with Shopify. Because of this, we only feel it's fair to offer the book at a discounted rate of $18.00 per raw book.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our hope is for the site to be operational by tomorrow, March 5th by 4PM EST. We will confirm this via email and through social media, so please keep an eye out for the updates.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are so sorry for this inconvenience. We know there are a lot of you from across the pond that stayed up late for this and for that we are truly sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully this will solve the problem.
