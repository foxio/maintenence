        <p>
            We are so very sorry that you have had difficulties buying your book from us. We never expected this kind of response and all the love you guys were sending your way completely crashed our site. We are working feverishly to get the site to a place to handle all of the traffic.
        </p>

            <strong>Tonight's sales has been moved to tomorrow, March 5th at 4pm EST.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are so sorry for this inconvenience. We know there are a lot of you from across the pond that stayed up late for this and for that we are truly sorry.
